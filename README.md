# Linux From Scratch 13.0-systemd Build Notes

This repository documents my practical journey of building a Linux system from source using the official Linux From Scratch 13.0-systemd book.

The purpose of this project is to understand how a Linux system is built from the ground up, starting from host preparation and the temporary toolchain, then entering the chroot environment, and finally building a complete bootable Linux system.

---

## Project Goal

The main goals of this project are:

* Build Linux From Scratch manually step by step.
* Document each chapter clearly.
* Record commands, errors, fixes, and lessons learned.
* Create a clean technical reference for future Linux system customization.
* Build a strong foundation for creating controlled Linux environments for academic and lab use.

## Current Build Status

The build has reached the `chroot` environment and is currently in Chapter 8: Installing Basic System Software.

The temporary toolchain and temporary tools stages have been completed successfully.

Current package: `Tcl 8.6.17`

Current working directory inside chroot: `/sources/tcl8.6.17/unix`

Current source directory variable: `SRCDIR=/sources/tcl8.6.17`

---

## Completed Major Stages

The following major stages have been completed:

* Preparing the host system
* Creating the LFS partition and mount point
* Downloading packages and patches
* Creating the temporary toolchain
* Building cross-compilation tools
* Building temporary tools
* Changing ownership to `root`
* Mounting virtual kernel file systems
* Entering the chroot environment
* Creating essential system directories
* Creating basic `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files
* Creating the `tester` user
* Creating initial log files
* Building temporary tools inside chroot
* Cleaning temporary documentation and `.la` files
* Removing `/tools`
* Starting Chapter 8 final system software

## Important Build Notes

The LFS base path before entering chroot is:

```bash
/mnt/lfs
```

The main environment variable used before chroot was:

```bash
LFS=/mnt/lfs
```

The temporary toolchain was built using:

```bash
/mnt/lfs/tools
```

The target triplet used during the build was:

```bash
x86_64-lfs-linux-gnu
```

Inside the chroot environment, the system is built from:

```bash
/sources
```

---

## Important Troubleshooting Notes

Several issues were encountered and resolved during the build.

### Glibc Test Timeouts

Some Glibc tests failed because of timeouts inside VirtualBox.

The likely cause was high system load, GNOME resource usage, Firefox usage, and high I/O wait.

The issue was handled by closing unnecessary applications and running the failed tests individually with a higher timeout factor:

```bash
TIMEOUTFACTOR=30 make -j1 test t=<test-name>
```

The following tests passed after being run individually:

```text
stdlib/test-bz22786
stdlib/test-cxa_atexit-race2
libio/tst-asprintf-null
```

The remaining known failure was:

```text
io/tst-lchmod
```

This failure is considered expected inside the chroot environment.

### Glibc Installation Issue

During Glibc installation, a previous `sed` command caused a Makefile issue where `$echo` remained instead of `echo`.

The error message was similar to:

```text
/bin/sh: line 1: cho: command not found
```

The issue was fixed before continuing the build.

## Documentation Method

Each chapter document is intended to include:

* Chapter purpose
* Required commands
* Explanation of important commands
* Expected output
* Verification steps
* Problems encountered
* Fixes applied
* Final result

This approach keeps the main README clean while keeping the detailed technical work inside the `docs/` directory.

## Why This Project Matters

Linux From Scratch is not just a Linux installation project.

It is a deep learning process that explains how the core parts of a Linux system are built and connected, including:

* Toolchains
* Compilers
* Libraries
* Shell utilities
* System directories
* Boot process
* System configuration
* Package compilation
* Dependency relationships

This knowledge is useful for Linux administration, operating system customization, secure system design, and building controlled environments for labs or academic use.

---

## Future Direction

After completing the LFS build, this repository may be extended with:

* More detailed chapter notes
* Build screenshots
* Troubleshooting records
* Reusable helper scripts
* System customization notes
* Notes for building controlled academic Linux environments

## Disclaimer

This repository is not a replacement for the official Linux From Scratch book.

It is a personal technical documentation project based on my own build environment, practical notes, errors, fixes, and learning process.

Commands and notes may need adjustment on other systems.
